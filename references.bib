  abstract = {Food retailers’ scanner data provide unprecedented details on local consumption, provided that product identifiers allow a linkage with features of interest, such as nutritional information. In this paper, we enrich a large retailer dataset with nutritional information extracted from crowd-sourced and administrative nutritional datasets. To compensate for imperfect matching through the barcode, we develop a methodology to efficiently match short textual descriptions. After a preprocessing step to normalize short labels, we resort to fuzzy matching based on several tokenizers (including n-grams) by querying an ElasticSearch customized index and validate candidates echos as matches with a Levensthein edit-distance and an embedding-based similarity measure created from a siamese neural network model. The pipeline is composed of several steps successively relaxing constraints to find relevant matching candidates.},

abstract = {The concept of present population is gaining increasing attention in official statistics. One possible approach to measure present population exploits data collected by Mobile Network Operators (MNO), from simple Call Detail Records (CDR) to more informative and complex signalling records. Such data, collected primarily for network operation processes, can be repurposed to infer patterns of human mobility. Two decades of research literature have produced several case studies, mostly focused on to CDR data, and a variety of ad-hoc methodologies tailored to specific datasets. Moving beyond the stage of explorative research, the regular production of official statistics across different MNO requires a more systematic approach to methodological development. Towards this aim, Eurostat and other members of the European Statistical System are working towards the definition of a general Reference Methodological Framework for processing MNO data for official statistics. In this contribution we report on the methodological aspects related to the estimation of present population density, for which we present a general and modular methodological structure that generalises previous proposals found in the academic literature. Along the way, we define a number of specific research problems requiring further attention by the research community. We stress the importance of comparing different methodological options at various points in the data workflow, e.g. in the geolocation of individual observations and in the inference method. Finally, we present illustrative results from a case-study based on real signalling data from a European operational network, complemented by numerical results from a simple simulation scenario.}

abstract={Maritime data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) have emerged as a potential source for real time information on trade activity. However, no globally applicable end-to-end solution has been published to transform raw AIS messages into economically meaningful, policy-relevant indicators of international trade. Our paper proposes and tests a set of algorithms to fill this gap. We build indicators of world seaborne trade using raw data from the radio signals that the global vessel fleet emits for navigational safety purposes. We leverage different machine-learning techniques to identify port boundaries, construct port-to-port voyages, and estimate trade volumes at the world, bilateral and within-country levels. Our methodology achieves a good fit with official trade statistics for many countries and for the world in aggregate. We also show the usefulness of our approach for sectoral analyses of crude oil trade, and for event studies such as Hurricane Maria and the effect of measures taken to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Going forward, ongoing refinements of our algorithms, additional data on vessel characteristics, and country-specific knowledge should help improve the performance of our general approach for several country cases.},

ABSTRACT={Social data in digital form—including user-generated content, expressed or implicit relations between people, and behavioral traces—are at the core of popular applications and platforms, driving the research agenda of many researchers. The promises of social data are many, including understanding “what the world thinks” about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics and practitioners have warned against the naïve usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked. This paper recognizes the rigor with which these issues are addressed by different researchers varies across a wide range. We identify a variety of menaces in the practices around social data use, and organize them in a framework that helps to identify them.<disp-quote>“For your own sanity, you have to remember that not all problems can be solved.
